  <p>       Here's Shoshone Falls, a place I love. I worked the Summer after High School and before my mission in Twin Falls. 
    In the evenings, I often came out here to hike around, and I found a perfect spot on a plateau overlooking the falls to sit.
    I'll never forget one specific evening while sitting above the falls and watching the sunset. While pondering and praying, I was filled with an overwhelming sense of hope and excitement for the future.
    If you're ever driving to the Boise area, I'd highly recommend taking the thirty minute detour to check out the falls.</p>
